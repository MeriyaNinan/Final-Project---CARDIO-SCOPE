# Final-Project---CARDIO-SCOPE
**Project Name:** *Cardiovascular disease detection and risk assessment

**Description:**  
"AI-Driven Heart Health" uses machine learning techniques to predict cardiovascular disease risk based on patient data. By analyzing various health indicators such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors, the project aims to provide early warnings of heart-related conditions. With accurate predictions, healthcare providers can offer personalized prevention and treatment strategies, potentially saving lives through timely interventions. The model has been optimized for high performance with hyperparameter tuning and is ready for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

Finally, we identified that the key goal of the project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the risk of cardiovascular disease using patient data. The best model, after hyperparameter tuning and evaluation, was the Voting Ensemble model. With a high training accuracy of 76.7% and testing accuracy of 72.9%, it shows strong performance for real-world application. The project is ready for deployment, with the model being serialized and integrated into a production pipeline for healthcare use.
