# Final-Project---CARDIO-SCOPE
**Project Name:** *Cardiovascular disease detection and risk assessment

**Description:**  
"AI-Driven Heart Health" uses machine learning techniques to predict cardiovascular disease risk based on patient data. By analyzing various health indicators such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors, the project aims to provide early warnings of heart-related conditions. With accurate predictions, healthcare providers can offer personalized prevention and treatment strategies, potentially saving lives through timely interventions. The model has been optimized for high performance with hyperparameter tuning and is ready for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.
CARDIOSCOPE--Cardiovascular-Disease-Detection-and-Risk-Assessment
CardioScope is a machine learning-based project aimed at predicting the presence of cardiovascular disease in individuals. By analyzing key health metrics such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and activity levels, the project identifies high-risk patients, enabling early intervention. Through data preprocessing, feature selection, and advanced model training, the final model achieves robust predictive accuracy. The insights derived from this project can support healthcare professionals in decision-making and pave the way for more efficient cardiovascular disease management systems.

Introduction
Project Background and Context

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are among the leading causes of mortality worldwide, accounting for a significant burden on healthcare systems. Early detection and preventive care are crucial to mitigating the risks associated with CVDs. However, traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and expensive.

CardioScope leverages machine learning to address this challenge by analyzing health data such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, glucose levels, and lifestyle factors. This predictive approach offers a cost-effective and efficient way to identify individuals at risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. By empowering healthcare providers with accurate predictions, the project contributes to improving public health outcomes and streamlining preventive care strategies.

Aim
To analyze cardiovascular disease data and build a predictive model to classify individuals as having or not having cardiovascular disease.

Problem Statement
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading global health concern, responsible for millions of deaths annually. Despite advances in medicine, a significant challenge remains: early identification of individuals at risk of developing CVDs. Traditional methods for diagnosis, such as clinical assessments and diagnostic tests, often rely on extensive resources, time, and specialized personnel, making them inaccessible to many, especially in resource-limited settings.

Moreover, lifestyle-related risk factors like smoking, physical inactivity, poor diet, and underlying conditions such as high blood pressure or cholesterol levels, play a critical role in the onset of CVDs. Yet, the complexity of these factors and their interplay often make early risk assessment a challenging task for healthcare providers.

Key Challenges Addressed in the Project:
Early Detection: Identifying CVD risk at an early stage to enable timely interventions.
Cost-Effectiveness: Providing a scalable and affordable solution for analyzing risk using easily accessible health data.
Automation: Using machine learning to simplify the process, reduce human dependency, and improve accuracy in predicting outcomes.
Personalization: Tailoring preventive recommendations based on individual health profiles and lifestyle factors.
By developing a predictive model, the project seeks to bridge the gap between clinical expertise and scalable healthcare solutions, ultimately aiming to reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases globally.

Main Objective
The main objective of the CardioScope project is to develop a predictive model for early detection of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk using readily available clinical and demographic data. This model is intended to assist healthcare providers in identifying high-risk individuals, enabling timely interventions to prevent or manage CVD.

Target Output
The target output of the project is a classification prediction (binary outcome) indicating whether an individual is at risk of having or developing cardiovascular disease. The target variable, cardio, is defined as follows:

0: No risk of cardiovascular disease.
1: At risk of cardiovascular disease.
Business Problem Addressed
The project aims to solve the problem of early identification of individuals at risk for cardiovascular diseases, which can help:

Improve patient outcomes by enabling early medical intervention.
Reduce healthcare costs by focusing on preventive measures rather than expensive treatments for advanced conditions.
Optimize healthcare resources by targeting high-risk populations for focused care.
Empower data-driven decision-making for healthcare practitioners and policymakers to design preventive strategies.
By achieving these objectives, CardioScope contributes to enhancing public health outcomes and reducing the global burden of cardiovascular diseases.

Dataset Overview
Rows (Records): Each row corresponds to an individual with their respective health parameters. Columns (Features): Represents health metrics, lifestyle indicators, and the target variable.

Data Structure
Numerical Features: age, ap_hi, ap_lo.Require normalization or standardization for consistent scale. Categorical Features: cholesterol, gluc, gender. May need encoding techniques (e.g., one-hot or label encoding) for modeling. Binary Features: smoke, alco, active, cardio. Easily interpretable and ready for use in machine learning algorithms. Imbalance in Target Variable: Ensure that the distribution of cardio is balanced to avoid bias.

Dataset
This dataset serves as a practical resource for healthcare professionals and data scientists to develop predictive models that could support early detection of cardiovascular diseases and promote preventive care.

Finally, we identified that the key goal of the project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the risk of cardiovascular disease using patient data. The best model, after hyperparameter tuning and evaluation, was the Voting Ensemble model. With a high training accuracy of 76.7% and testing accuracy of 72.9%, it shows strong performance for real-world application. The project is ready for deployment, with the model being serialized and integrated into a production pipeline for healthcare use.
